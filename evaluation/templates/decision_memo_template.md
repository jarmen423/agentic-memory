## Decision Summary

- Recommended default:
- Optional path:
- Decision state: `pending` | `final`

## Evidence Snapshot

| Workflow | Success Rate | Avg Latency (ms) | Avg Token Cost (USD) | Avg Retries | Avg Operator Steps |
|----------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| `mcp_native` | | | | | |
| `skill_adapter` | | | | | |

## Parity Check

- Success parity met:
- Latency parity met:
- Token-cost parity met:
- Operator-step parity met:

## Recommendation Rule Applied

- If all parity checks pass: promote both workflows as first-class.
- Otherwise: keep `mcp_native` as recommended default and keep `skill_adapter` optional.

## Rationale

1. Reliability:
2. Operational complexity:
3. Cost profile:
